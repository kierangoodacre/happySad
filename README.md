# happySadJS

Introduction

A programme that determines whether or not text is happy or sad.

|Languages |Frameworks|Testing         |
|----------|----------|---------       |
|Javascript|NodeJS    | Jasmine-Jquery |
|CSS       |jQuery    | Jasmine        |
|HTML      |Express   |                |
|          |          |                |


Choices
----------

I chose to use a Node/Express server as it quickly allows you to host the routes required for fast and efficient feature testing using jasmine-jquery. It was my first real flurry into using jasmine-jquery for purely feature tests but my overall thoughts on it are that I like it very much and would definately use it again.
